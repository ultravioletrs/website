                  Subject to all limitations and restrictions contained herein and the Quote,
                  Service Provider grants Customer a subscription, PRISM AI, nonexclusive, and

                  (and use its Documentation) as hosted by Service Provider as described in the

                <p>
                  Customer will have a limited right to Use the Application solely for its internal
                  business purposes, to perform the functions described in the Documentation.
                  Customer shall not allow any website that is not fully owned by Customer to frame,
                  syndicate, distribute, replicate, or copy any portion of Customer's web site that
                  provides direct or indirect access to the Application. Customer shall not allow
                  any website, that is not fully owned by Customer, to frame, syndicate, distribute,
                  replicate, or copy any portion of Customer's web site that provides direct or
                  indirect access to the Software. Unless otherwise expressly permitted in the Quote
                  and subject to Section 1.5, Customer shall not permit any subsidiaries, affiliated
                  companies, or third parties to access the Software. Subject to these Terms, PRISM

                  1.3 Subscription Type:
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Unless otherwise specifically stated in the Quote, the type of license granted is
                  a Node Based Subscription. A "Node Based Subscription" means that the Application
                  subscribed to pursuant to the Quote may be Used by a limited number of individual
                  Nodes, which denotes a computer hardware device (of any type, form or
                  configuration) that is identified by a unique device ID (the "Node"), the maximum
                  number of which is specified in the Quote. Customer may designate different Nodes
                  at any time without notice to Service Provider so long as the permitted number of
                  Nodes is not exceeded. If the Quote identifies the scope of the subscription to be
                  a "Site Subscription," a "Site Subscription" means that the Application subscribed
                  to pursuant to the Quote may be Used by an unlimited number of individual users
                  solely for the internal Use and benefit of Customer, subject to the terms of these
                  PRISM AI Terms. A "Server Subscription" means that the Application subscribed to
                  pursuant to the Quote may be Used on no more than the number of servers indicated
                  in the Quote. The scope of any subscription other than a Node Based Subscription,
                  Site Subscription, or Server Subscription must be expressly designated and defined
                  in detail in a Quote. In no event will any of the subscriptions denoted above be
                  construed to mean a concurrent user subscription.

                  so. Disassembling, decompiling, and reverse engineering include, without
                  limitation: (i) converting the Application from a machine-readable form into a
                  human-readable form; (ii) disassembling or decompiling the Application by using
                  any means or methods to translate machine-dependent or machine-independent object
                  code into the original human-readable source code or any approximation thereof;
                  (iii) examining the machine-readable object code that controls the Application's
                  operation and creating the original source code or any approximation thereof by,
                  for example, studying the Application's behavior in response to a variety of
                  inputs; or (iv) performing any other activity related to the Application that
                  could be construed to be reverse engineering, disassembling, or decompiling. To
                  the extent any such activity may be permitted pursuant to written agreement, the
                  results thereof will be deemed Confidential Information subject to the
                  requirements of these PRISM AI Terms.

                </h3>
                <p>
                  Customer shall pay Service Provider the fees indicated on the Quote. Unless
                  otherwise provided in a Quote, all fees are to be paid to Service Provider within
                  thirty (30) days of the date of invoice. Any late payment will be subject to any
                  costs of collection (including reasonable legal fees) and will bear interest at
                  the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (prorated for partial
                  periods) or at the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less. If Customer
                  has set up a direct debit, Service Provider will not debit Customer's designated
                  account before seven (7) days have elapsed from the date of the invoice. If
                  Customer is delinquent on a payment of fees for fifteen (15) days or more, Service
                  Provider may suspend access to the Application. Complaints concerning invoices
                  must be made in writing within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice.
                  Invoices will be sent by electronic delivery unless requested otherwise by
                  Customer, additional fees will apply.

                <p>
                  The subscription, service fees, and other amounts required to be paid hereunder do
                  not include any amount for taxes or levy (including interest and penalties).
                  Customer shall reimburse Service Provider and hold Service Provider harmless for
                  all sales, use, VAT, excise, property or other taxes or levies which Service
                  Provider is required to collect or remit to applicable tax authorities. This
                  provision does not apply to Service Provider's income or franchise taxes, or any
                  taxes for which Customer is exempt, provided Customer has furnished Service
                  Provider with a valid tax exemption certificate. The Customer will pay all import
                  duties, levies or imposts, and all goods and services sales, use, value added or
                  property taxes of any nature, assessed upon or with respect to the PRISM AI Terms.
                  If the Customer is required by law to make any deduction or to withhold from any
                  sum payable to the Service Provider by the Customer hereunder, then the sum
                  payable by the Customer upon which the deduction or withholding is based shall be
                  increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after such deduction or
                  withholding, the Service Provider receives and retains, free from liability for
                  such deduction or withholding, a net amount equal to the amount the Service
                  Provider would have received and retained in the absence of such required
                  deduction or withholding. If the Customer is required by law to make any such
                  deduction or withholding, the Customer shall promptly effect payment thereof to
                  the applicable tax authorities. The Customer shall also promptly provide the
                  Service Provider with official tax receipts or other evidence issued by the
                  applicable tax authorities sufficient to enable the Service Provider to support a
                  claim (if applicable) for income tax credits in the Service Provider's applicable
                  taxable country.
