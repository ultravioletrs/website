There is a strange paradox at the heart of the "Confidential Computing" industry.

On one hand, the premise is simple and powerful: **mathematically guaranteed privacy**. By using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) like AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX, we can theoretically prove that no one—not even the cloud provider—can peek at your data.

On the other hand, many solutions that promise this transparency are themselves built on **proprietary, closed-source blobs**. They ask you to trust their "secure enclave," but they won't show you the code running inside it.

At Cube AI, we believe this approach is fundamentally flawed. **You cannot have Confidential Computing without Open Source.**

## The "Black Box" Problem

In security engineering, there is a famous concept known as **Kerckhoffs's principle**: a cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.

When a vendor sells you a closed-source confidential computing platform, they are violating this principle. They are asking you to trust a "Black Box."
*   How do you know the attestation report isn't being spoofed by a hardcoded key?
*   How do you verify there are no backdoors in the control plane?
*   How can you audit the memory encryption handling if you can't see the source?

If the code protecting your secrets is itself a secret, you aren't buying security; you're buying a promise. And in the world of high-stakes AI—where medical records, financial strategies, and IP are on the line—promises aren't enough.

## Security Through Transparency

This is why Cube AI is built on a foundation of **radical transparency**. We made a conscious decision to open-source our entire core stack. We want you to verify, not just trust.

Our architecture relies on battle-tested open-source libraries that are open for peer review.

### Powered by Cocos AI

A critical component of our stack is [**Cocos AI**](https://github.com/ultravioletrs/cocos). Cocos provides the essential confidential computing layer for AI workloads. It abstracts the complexities of the underlying TEE hardware, allowing us to deploy confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) across different cloud providers seamlessly.

By building on top of Cocos, we ensure that the very mechanism creating the "enclave" is transparent. You can inspect the code to see exactly how:
*   The connection to the TEE hardware is established.
*   The guest memory is managed.
*   The transition from "untrusted" to "trusted" execution occurs.

### Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

We don't reinvent the wheel when it comes to cryptography. Our attestation flow relies on standard, industry-verified libraries:

*   **`google/go-sev-guest` & `google/go-tdx-guest`**: These libraries, maintained by Google's security team, provide the low-level primitives for communicating with AMD and Intel hardware. They ensure that our parsing of attestation reports adheres to the strictest manufacturer specifications.
*   **`absmach/certs`**: We use this for managing the certificate chains that validate the hardware's identity.

By using these open upstream projects, we ensure that Cube AI benefits from the collective security research of the entire open-source community.

## Building Trustworthy AI Infrastructure

For developers and CTOs, the open-source model offers more than just philosophical satisfaction—it renders tangible business value.

1.  **Auditable Security**: Your security team can audit every line of code that processes your sensitive LLM prompts. There is no "magic" occurring behind a proprietary API.
2.  **No Vendor Lock-in**: Because the stack is open, you aren't beholden to a single vendor's roadmap. You can fork, extend, or contribute back to the project to suit your specific needs.
3.  **Faster Innovation**: Open source accelerates adoption. When developers can easily spin up a local instance of Cube AI, inspect the attestation flow, and integrate it into their apps without a sales call, the ecosystem grows stronger.

## Join the Confidential Revolution

We believe that the future of AI is private, and the future of privacy is open.

We invite you to stop trusting blindly and start verifying. 
*   **Check out our code**: [Cube AI on GitHub](https://github.com/ultravioletrs/cube)
*   **Inspect the core**: [Cocos AI on GitHub](https://github.com/ultravioletrs/cocos)
*   **Verify the dependencies**: Look at our `go.mod` to see exactly what goes into your build.

Confidential Computing shouldn't be a secret. It should be a standard.
