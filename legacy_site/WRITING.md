# How to Write and Publish a Blog Post

This guide explains the process of creating a new blog post, testing it locally, and submitting it for publication.

## 1. Create the Content

### Create the Markdown File

Add a new `.md` file in the `content/blogs/` directory. The filename should be descriptive (e.g., `my-new-feature.md`).

### Add Frontmatter

Every post **must** start with YAML frontmatter between `---` markers:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
slug: "url-friendly-slug"
excerpt: "A compelling 2-3 sentence summary"
description: "SEO meta description (150-160 characters)"
date: "2024-01-15"
author:
  name: "Jane Doe"
  picture: "/assets/team/jane-doe.jpg"
coverImage: "/assets/blog/my-post-cover.jpg"
ogImage:
  url: "/assets/blog/my-post-og.jpg"
category: blog
featured: true
tags:
  - Web Development
  - Prism
---
```

### Write the Post

Below the closing `---`, write in standard Markdown.

## 2. Add Images (Optional)

If your post includes images:

1. Create a directory named after your post's slug in `img/blogs/`. For example: `img/blogs/my-new-feature/`.
2. Place your images there.
3. Reference them in your Markdown: `![Description](/img/blogs/my-new-feature/screenshot.png)`.

## 3. Test Locally

After writing your post, you should build the site and preview the generated HTML.

1. **Build the blog:**

   ```bash
   make build
   ```

This generates the static site into the output folder (e.g. blog/).

2. **Open with a Live Server**
   Use a live server to preview the generated files.
   - Option A - VS Code Live Server (recommended)
     - Install the Live Server extension in VS Code
     - Open the project folder in VS Code
     - Navigate to the generated output directory (e.g. blog/)
     - Right-click index.html → “Open with Live Server”
   - Option B - Any static file server  
     You can also use other tools, for example:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. **Verify Your Post**  
   Open the local URL shown by the Live Server and check:
   - Your post appears on the blog listing page
   - The post page renders correctly
   - Images load
   - Links work

If something looks off, fix your Markdown or frontmatter and run make build again.

## 4. Publish via Pull Request

1. **Create a new branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b blog/my-new-feature
   ```
2. **Build the blog:**
   ```bash
   make build
   ```
   This ensures the `blog/` directory is updated with your new post and reflects any changes in the listing pages.
3. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add content/blogs/my-new-feature.md img/blogs/my-new-feature/ blog/ .blogcache
   git commit -m "Add blog post: My New Feature"
   ```
   **Note:** It is important to include the `blog/` folder and `.blogcache` in your commit so that the static site is updated upon merging.
4. **Push and open a PR:**
   Push your branch to GitHub and open a Pull Request against the `main` branch.
